								<span>Hear then the story of our common woe.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>At dead of night when all the lamps were out,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He took his two-edged sword, as if intent</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On some wild expedition. So I chid him,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Saying, “What dost thou, Ajax, why go forth?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No summons, messenger or trumpet blast,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath called thee; nay, by now the whole host sleeps.”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He answered lightly with an ancient saw,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“Woman, for women silence is a grace.”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Admonished thus I held my tongue; but he</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sped forth alone. What happened afterwards</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I know not, but he came back with his spoil,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oxen and sheep-dogs with their fleecy charge.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Some he beheads, of some the upturned necks</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He cuts, or cleaves the chine; others again</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He buffeted and mangled in their bonds,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mauling the beasts, as if they had been men.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>At last he darted through the door and held</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wild converse with some phantom of the brain;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now the Atridae, and Odysseus now,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He mocked with peals of laughter, vaunting loud</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The vengeance he had wreaked on them. Anon</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He rushed indoors again; and then in time</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With painful struggles was himself again.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And as he scanned the havoc all around,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He smote his head and wailed and sank to earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A wreck among the wreck of slaughtered sheep,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Digging into his hair his clenchèd nails.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>At first⁠—a long, long while⁠—he spake no word,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then against me he uttered those dire threats,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If I declared not all that had befallen,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bidding me tell him in what plight he stood.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And I a-tremble told him what had chanced,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So far as I had knowledge. Whereat he</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Broke into lamentations, piercing, shrill,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such as I ne’er had heard from him before.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For ’twas his creed that wailings and lament</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Are for the craven and faint-hearts; no shrill</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Complaint escaped him ever; his low moan</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was like the muffled bellowing of a bull.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But now, confounded in his abject woe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Refusing food or drink, he sits there still,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Just where he fell amid the carcases</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of the slain sheep and cattle. And ’tis plain</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He meditates some mischief, so I read</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His muttered exclamations and laments.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Come, friends, and help me, if so be ye can⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This was my errand⁠—men in case like his</span>

								<span>My sire, a peerless warrior, home returned</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Proclaimed as champion bravest of the brave.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And I, his son, in might not less than he,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sailed after him to this same land of Troy,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And served the host by deeds of no less worth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And for reward I perish by the Greeks</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dishonoured. Yet one thing I know full well:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If to Achilles living it had fallen</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His arms as meed of valour to award,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No man had grasped the prize, preferred to me.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But now the Atridae, scouting my just claim,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have yielded to a miscreant’s base intrigue.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Had not mine eyes been dazed, my mind distraught</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And wrested from its purpose, they had never</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Procured false sentence ’gainst a second man.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Alas! the grim-eyed goddess, unsubdued</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Daughter of Zeus⁠—as I was at their heels,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Almost at grips with them, in act to strike⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Foiled me, abused me by a frenzy fit,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Imbrued my hands with blood of these poor beasts.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And thus my foes exult in their escape,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Albeit I willed it not, and mock at me.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But if some god or goddess intervene,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Even a knave may worst the better man.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And now what’s left me? By the gods, ’tis clear,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I am detested, hated by the host</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Greeks, abhorred by Troy and all the camp.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall I sail homeward o’er the Aegean, leave</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sons of Atreus to fight on alone,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This roadstead undefended? Then how face</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My father Telamon? How will he endure</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To look on me returning empty-handed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Without the meed of valour that he held</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Himself, a crown of everlasting fame?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That were intolerable. Am I then</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Alone to storm the Trojan battlements,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And facing single-handed a whole host,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Do some high deed of prowess⁠—and so die?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nay, that methinks would give the Atridae joy.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It may not be; some emprise must be found</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That shall convince my aged sire his son</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is not degenerate from his father’s breed.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Base were it that a man should want long life</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When all he gets is long unchanging trouble.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What pleasure comes of that? ’Tis but a move</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Left amidst foemen. But I go my way</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To the sea baths and meadows by the beach,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That I may there assoil me and assuage</span>

								<span>A foe’s gifts are no gifts and profit not.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>They are our rulers and obey we must;</span>

								<span>Gives place to opulent summer. Night’s dim orb</span>

								<span>Is put to flight when Dawn with her white steeds</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Kindles the day-beams; and the wind’s fierce breath</span>
								<br/>

								<br/>

								<span>‘Seek victory, my son’ (so warned the sire),</span>

								<span>‘But seek it ever with the help of heaven.’</span>

								<br/>
								<span>‘Father, with gods to aid, a man of naught</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Might well prevail, but I without their help.’</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such was his haughty boast. A second time,</span>

								<br/>
								<span>He spake a blasphemous, outrageous word,</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Nay, though a man should tower in thews and might,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A giant o’er his fellows, let him think</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Some petty stroke of fate may work his ruin.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where dread prevails and reverence withal,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Believe me, there is safety; but the State,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where arrogance hath licence and self-will,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though for a while she run before the gale,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Will in the end make shipwreck and be sunk.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dread in its proper season and degree</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Must be maintained; let us not fondly dream</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That we can act at will to please ourselves,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor pay the price of pleasure by our pains.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Tis turn and turn; now this man lorded it</span>

								<span>But by the lot he drew⁠—no skulking lot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
								<br/>
								<span>No lump of loam, but one that well he knew</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Would first leap lightly from the crested helm?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such deeds were his, and at his side was I,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This slave, of a barbarian mother born.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How canst thou prate thus idly? Look at home.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hast thou forgotten that thine own sire’s sire</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was Phrygian Pelops, a barbarian?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That Atreus who begat thee, wretch, did set</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Before his brother a most impious feast,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His brother’s children’s flesh? That thou thyself</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Com’st of a Cretan mother whom her sire</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Caught with an alien slave, her paramour,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And sent to feed dumb fishes of the deep?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thus basely born thou twit’st me with my birth!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My sire was Telamon who won the prize</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As champion of the host, a peerless bride,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A princess, daughter of Laomedon,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The meed assigned him by Alemena’s son.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>She was my mother. And am I, thus born</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nobly of parents both of noblest birth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Am I to shame my kindred overthrown,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now helpless, whelmed in utter misery,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whom thou wouldst spurn and rob of burial rites,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor art ashamed to promulgate this ban?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Know this full well, where’er ye cast this man,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We three, three corpses, ye will cast beside.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For me ’twere nobler before all men’s eyes</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To fall in his behalf than for a wife</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of thine⁠—or of thy brother, should I say?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Therefore bethink thee⁠—’tis thine interest</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No less than mine⁠—if on me thou dar’st lay</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A finger, thou wilt surely wish full soon</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rather to bear the brand of cowardice</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Than prove thy reckless bravery on me.</span>
